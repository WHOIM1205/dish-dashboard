# Dish Dashboard

A full-stack application to manage and display dishes. The dashboard lists all
dishes, lets you toggle each dish's published status, and reflects changes
across every connected client in real time using Socket.IO.

## Features

- **View dishes** – see all dishes with image, name, and published status.
- **Toggle publish status** – publish/unpublish a dish; the UI and database
  update immediately.
- **Real-time updates** – when a dish changes anywhere (another tab, another
  user, or directly on the backend), all connected dashboards update
  automatically, with no page reload.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React
- Vite

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express

**Database**
- Prisma
- SQLite

**Realtime**
- Socket.IO

## Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env                 # provides DATABASE_URL and PORT (required by Prisma)
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init   # creates the SQLite DB, generates the client, and seeds it
npm run dev                          # starts the server on http://localhost:4000
```

> Windows (PowerShell): use `copy .env.example .env` instead of `cp`.

## Frontend Setup

> Start the backend first (see above) and keep it running. Then, in a **second
> terminal**, run the frontend — it talks to the backend on `localhost:4000`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                          # starts the dashboard on http://localhost:5173
```

### Environment variables (frontend)

`VITE_API_URL` is **optional**. It sets the backend URL the Socket.IO client
connects to. If not provided, it defaults to `http://localhost:4000`, which is
correct for local development. To override, create a `frontend/.env` file:

```
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:4000"
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                   | Description                          |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/api/dishes`              | Returns all dishes.                  |
| PATCH  | `/api/dishes/:id/toggle`   | Toggles a dish's `isPublished` flag. |
| GET    | `/health`                  | Health check, returns `{status:"ok"}`. |

## Realtime Flow

1. A client (or a direct backend action) calls
   `PATCH /api/dishes/:id/toggle`.
2. The backend updates the dish in the database via Prisma.
3. On success, the backend emits a `dishUpdated` event through Socket.IO with
   the updated dish `{ id, dishId, dishName, imageUrl, isPublished }`.
4. The event is broadcast to **all** connected clients.
5. Each dashboard listens for `dishUpdated` and surgically updates only the
   matching dish in its state — no full refetch and no page reload.

Because the event fires on every successful toggle regardless of its origin, a
change made directly on the backend updates every open dashboard as well.
